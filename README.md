#   MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis


# Project Overview

This project is about analyzing metrics can  impact manufacturing a new car prototype  and compare vehicle performance ,The project involves the use of statistics and hypothesis testing to analyze a series of datasets from the automotive industry the comparsion including different factors such as   vehicle length, weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, AWD capabilities, MPG, and PSI


# Linear Regression to Predict MPG

mpg = 6.27 * vehicle_length + 1.25e-3 * vehicle_weigth + 6.88e-2 * spoiler_angle -3.41 * AWD + 3.55 * ground_clearance - 1.04e+2
